Jorge HTML SUPPORT

I joined the team a little late. For this project I was able to help the team
with some documentation and resources about html. 
First, I started a website example for the server. For this project I used:

Html code for reading the site
Css for the appearance and style
JQuery for the animation and interactivity 

After that I used the program WinSCP to upload the files to our Sootsplash server.
WinSCP:It is a free software that use SSH protocol. The main function is making it easy and secure 
to transfer files between remote systems (Windows or LInux) or local networks that use SSH.

Our team made a decision to make a faster and simple website. Then, I contributed with the team with some html codes
for the menu of our website.
